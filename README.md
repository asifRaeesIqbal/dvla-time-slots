A small veterinary practice requires a computerised appointment booking system for animals visiting the practice.
 
At the moment there is only one vet and the only animals the practice sees along with the time required for an appointment is shown below:
 
Animal
Appointment time required

Dog
60 minutes

Cat
45 minutes

Rabbit
30 minutes
 
Soon the system will need to deal with more animals so solution should be easily cope with this requirement.
 
Appointments start at 9:00am and finish at 5:00pm, there is no lunch period.  Any appointment should finish on or before 5:00pm.
 
There are no advance appointments and people call up in the morning to request an appointment for that day.  The input received for each appointment is the name of the pet, contact telephone number, age and type of animal.  The output is a time for the appointment or if no time left indicates there are no more appointments.
 
Write the code that is required to allocate appointments for the different animals with a small test harness that shows the code in operation for a full day.  A list of allocated appointments should be maintained.
 
If there is time left add the ability to display the list of current appointments for the day.
 
The code will be assessed against the above specification, general code quality, and adherence to accepted object-oriented principles including future extensibility of the code (such as additional animals and vets).
